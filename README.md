# DroneSegNet



The SCSE (Squeeze-and-Channel-Excitation) block enhances feature maps by first aggregating spatial information to create channel descriptors and then recalibrating the feature responses through learned channel weights. This dynamic adjustment allows the model to focus on important features while suppressing less relevant ones, improving overall performance in tasks like image segmentation.


i have used SCSE in decoder 


i have used resnet as encoder
