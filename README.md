# DroneSegNet



The SCSE (Squeeze-and-Channel-Excitation) block enhances feature maps by first aggregating spatial information to create channel descriptors and then recalibrating the feature responses through learned channel weights. This dynamic adjustment allows the model to focus on important features while suppressing less relevant ones, improving overall performance in tasks like image segmentation.


i have used SCSE in decoder 


i have used resnet as encoder 


A ResNet block is a fundamental building block of residual networks that allows for the training of very deep neural networks by introducing skip connections, which enable the input to bypass one or more layers. This architecture helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem and allows the network to learn identity functions, improving convergence and overall performance in tasks like image recognition.
